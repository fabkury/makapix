# MQTT Password File Example
# ===========================
# 
# This file contains Mosquitto password hashes. DO NOT commit actual passwords!
# 
# To generate passwords for your MQTT users:
#
# 1. Create a new password file:
#    touch mqtt/config/passwords
#
# 2. Add users with mosquitto_passwd:
#    mosquitto_passwd -b mqtt/config/passwords svc_backend YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD
#    mosquitto_passwd -b mqtt/config/passwords player_client YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD
#
# 3. Or use the provided script:
#    ./mqtt/config/scripts/gen-passwd.sh
#
# Example format (DO NOT USE - these are placeholders):
# svc_backend:$7$101$EXAMPLE_HASH_DO_NOT_USE$placeholder==
# player_client:$7$101$EXAMPLE_HASH_DO_NOT_USE$placeholder==
#
# Security Notes:
# - Use strong, unique passwords for each MQTT user
# - Never commit the actual passwords file to version control
# - Rotate passwords regularly
# - The password file is already in .gitignore
