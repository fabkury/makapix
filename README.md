# Makapix Club

A quiet corner of the internet for pixel artists and makers who care more about the work than the algorithm.

**Open-source. Ad-free. No algorithms deciding what you see.**

## Why Makapix Exists

Most social platforms are built to keep you scrolling. They optimize for engagement, sell your attention to advertisers, and bury your work under algorithmic noise. Your creations become content to be consumed and forgotten.

Makapix was built for the opposite reason.

This is a place where your work stays yours. No ads. No promoted posts. No subscription tiers. No mystery algorithm deciding who sees what. Just a straightforward space to document your projects and share them with people who actually want to see them.

The goal is permanence, not virality. Your pixel art and maker projects deserve a home that respects them.

## What You Can Do on Makapix

- **Publish your pixel art** with titles, descriptions, and hashtags
- **Document your maker projects** from microcontroller builds to embedded experiments
- **Create playlists and galleries** to organize your work the way you want
- **Display your art on physical devices** through MQTT integration with LED matrices and displays
- **Build a portfolio** that belongs to you, not to an algorithm

This is a place for showing, not scrolling.

## Who Makapix Is For

- Pixel artists who want their work seen on its own terms
- DIY makers and embedded systems hobbyists
- People building with microcontrollers, LED matrices, and small displays
- Creators who value craft over clout
- Anyone tired of platforms that treat art as engagement bait

If you are looking for viral reach or influencer tools, this is not the place.
If you want a calm, intentional space to share what you make, you are welcome here.

## Open Source and Community Values

Makapix is fully open-source. The code is available, the roadmap is public, and contributions are welcome.

- **Self-host if you want** - run your own instance for your community
- **Contribute** - improvements, bug fixes, and ideas are all appreciated
- **Stay informed** - no hidden changes or surprise monetization

This project is built to last. Sustainability comes from simplicity and community support, not from growth metrics or venture capital.
